    <p>Angel Educational Complex is a one-stop pre-tertiary educational hub comprising Pre-School, Primary School, Junior High School, and Senior High School. The school was founded on 7th September, 2004 by Dr. Kwaku Oteng, an entrepreneur, industrialist and a philanthropist.

        The complex seeks to train children, both Ghanaians and foreigners to acquire the requisite knowledge, skills, appropriate attitudes, aptitudes and competence that can be woven into a strategy to ensure that education lives up to its responsibility to serve the needs of humanity.</p>

    <p>Why Choose Angel Educational Complex?
        The motto of the Complex “Nation Building Through Excellent Training” was carefully and thoughtfully coined to complement the realization of the goals of the nation, Ghana. Such training cannot be complete without an exposure to international cultural dimensions since the world is now considered as a global village.
        
        The founder believes that education is incomplete if it is deficient of cultural education. Therefore, there is the need to promote national and cultural identity and citizenship. Inter-cultural relationship with the outside world would promote exposure to cultural varieties and experiences whose benefits are enormous and rewarding.</p>
